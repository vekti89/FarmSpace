# FarmSpace
Marketplace app connecting farmers and customers in San Francisco Bay Area. 

It serves both as: 
* a platform for farm owners to present their farms and products that they are offering
* a marketplace for custommers to buy fresh locally grown food

This is a [Node Express](https://expressjs.com/) project built using ejs as a templating language.
The app is connected to [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) database via [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) object data mapper.
